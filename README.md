# The game about a cube who jumps

By Rodrigo Seguel

## What is this... thing?

"This thing"?, its not a thing. "**THIS MASTERPIECE**" was a little project created in unity as my first "game", its not the most cute thing that i ever made but hey its something.

## What's the current state of the game?

Well, it works... sometimes... i guess?

## How do i get "this" running in my computer?

The game was developed in **Unity 2019.4.19f1 (LTS)** but i try the vertion 2020.2.2f.1 and it works nice on it.

You need to open the project on unity and start it on the editor or create the build of it in the version that you are gonna play (windows, linux or mac), also you are completely free to see the unity files and edit the game in general (**contact me to see what you have done, its gonna make me so happy :D**).

**I recommend the use of a controller**
